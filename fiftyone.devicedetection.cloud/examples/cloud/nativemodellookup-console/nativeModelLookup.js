/**
@example cloud/nativemodellookup-console/nativeModelLookup.js

This example shows how to use the 51Degrees Cloud service to lookup the details of a device
based on a given 'native model name'. Native model name is a string of characters that are
returned from a query to the device's OS.
There are different mechanisms to get native model names for
[Android devices](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#MODEL) and
[iOS devices](https://gist.github.com/soapyigu/c99e1f45553070726f14c1bb0a54053b#file-machinename-swift)

This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-node/blob/master/fiftyone.devicedetection.cloud/examples/cloud/nativemodellookup-console/nativeModelLookup.js).
